Everything is done now, you have installed the Netflix Content Blocker.

## Usage

After installing the extension, you will see small changes whenever you enter on the [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com) website.
The changes are:
1. There is a flag next to each movie square on the screen:

By clicking on this flag, you are marking that movie as inapropriate for you to watch it, and, therefore, it will be imetially hiden and you won't be able to see it again.
2. There are missing movies on the grid:

All flaged movies will now appear as missing movies on the grid.
3. Pre flagged movies: There is a preloaded list of flagged movies here. This is an ever changing list, and you can make a small change in the script to not use it if you want only your local selection. You can also contribute by proposing new movies and the reason to flag them.
